                    A tsunami is a series of ocean waves caused by any large and sudden disturbance of the sea surface, such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite impact. Tsunamis can vary in size and intensity, but they are all potentially dangerous and can cause widespread destruction along coastlines.

                <h3>Types of Tsunami:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Distant Tsunamis:</strong> These tsunamis are generated by major earthquakes that occur under the ocean floor. The seismic waves from the earthquake displace the ocean water, creating the tsunami. Distant tsunamis can travel across entire ocean basins and may take several hours to reach coastal areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Tsunamis:</strong> These tsunamis are generated by events that occur close to shore, such as underwater landslides or volcanic eruptions. They typically have shorter warning times and can reach coastal areas within minutes.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Predicting the Occurrence of Tsunami</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tsunamis are often preceded by earthquakes. Seismic monitoring stations can detect earthquakes and provide early warnings for potential tsunamis.</li>
                    <li>In some regions, buoy systems are deployed to detect changes in sea level that indicate the presence of a tsunami. These buoys transmit real-time data to monitoring centers.</li>
                    <li> Some countries have installed sensors on the ocean floor to detect changes in water pressure, which can indicate the passage of a tsunami wave.</li>
                </ul>
